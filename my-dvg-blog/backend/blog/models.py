    # The get_username() method is a standard method of Django's User model, which returns the username of the user.
    # So, for example, if you have a Profile object associated with a User whose username is 'john_doe', when you call print() on this Profile object, the output will be 'john_doe'.

    # profile = Profile.objects.get(id=1)  # Assume this profile belongs to the user 'john_doe'
    # print(profile)  # This will output: john_doe
    # __str__ will make the Profile objects appear in a more human-friendly manner on the admin site
